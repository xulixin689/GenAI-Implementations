# GenAI Projects

This repository contains several GenAI implementations that I wrote. The projects cover a range of cutting-edge techniques including transformer enhancements, diffusion-based image generation, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and text-guided image editing.

## Projects Overview

- **GPT-2 with RoPE & GQA:** Improved a vanilla GPT model by integrating Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) to build a custom Language Model using the complete works of Shakespeare.
- **Diffusion-Based Image Generation:** Implemented a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) using the Animal Faces-HQ (AFHQ) dataset (cat images) to explore state-of-the-art techniques for image denoising and generation.
- **LoRA-Enabled GPT-2 Fine-Tuning:** Developed a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a pre-trained GPT2 model applied to the Rotten Tomatoes sentiment analysis dataset.
- **Prompt-to-Prompt Image Editing:** Built a text-driven image editing pipeline leveraging cross-attention maps in a diffusion model framework to modify specific scene elements while preserving overall image structure.
